# ActiveFolders
This script parses a folder tree and creates HTML report of "active folders" (folders whose contents were modified on a certain day) for every day of the year. This can be useful for locating projects/saves that were created/modified on a certain day or time. This makes moving project folders easy, since they can always be relocated by date.
